# Show a custom offline page

Display a more engaging custom branded offline webpage when users move offline
instead of the generic default web browser one.

A custom offline page is a good fallback option on any project even if the full
offline experience is going to be out of budget.

## UX Suggestions

- keep it current
- display any blog entries you’ve added to the cache
- display part of the app shell so it looks like the user is still in the app
- What if we made our offline page so useful that users wanted to navigate to it?
